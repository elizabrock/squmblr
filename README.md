    2. `rake db:migrate`
* Database initialization
    1. `rake db:seed`

## Setup Instructions

In order to utilize functionality of Figaro (which allows you to hide secrets and keys),
follow the below instructions:

1. Copy `config/application.yml.example` to `config/application.yml`
2. Fill in the correct Github API key (either get them from Eliza or set one up under developer applications, here: https://github.com/settings/applications)
3. `rake db:create:all`
4. `rake db:migrate`
5. `rake`
6. Confirm that rake passed.  If it didn't, that means your setup is missing something.
7. Make sure `config/application.yml` is in your .gitignore file
